# Coconut Clicker

## Objectives
Coconut Clicker is a fun, incremental game inspired by the classic Cookie Clicker. The main objectives of the project include:

- Implementing a cookie-clicker style game in JavaScript
- Adding points for each click
- Allowing users to select and import their own PNG images for the clicker
- Creating an upgrade shop to spend points for upgrading click power
- Unlocking special features after reaching certain milestones (e.g., 1,000 clicks)
- Introducing a battle mode where players can compete using keystrokes
- Learning and experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Description
Coconut Clicker is an incremental game where players click on a giant cocnut (or their chosen image) to earn points. These points can be used to buy upgrades and enhance click power, fostering a sense of progression and strategy. While the game aims to capture the essence of the original Cookie Clicker, it will be a simpler, more accessible version designed to be both functional and enjoyable.
